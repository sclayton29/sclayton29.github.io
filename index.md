Hi! My name is Sarah Pugachev (formerly Sarah Clayton). I am a librarian interested in how technology can be used thoughtfully to benefit research and teaching. I am especially passionate about digital literacy and open access.

Currently, I am the Director of Research Initiatives at the University of Rochester River Campus Libraries. Our team works on projects related to increasing the visiblity of scholarship and supporting the research enterprise at UR. 

[I was named a Library Journal Mover and Shaker in 2017](https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=sarah-clayton-movers-shakers-2017-digital-developers#_). I have been a certified [Carpentries' instructor](https://carpentries.org/) since 2016 and an instructor trainer since 2018. 

When I'm not working, I live to spend my time playing with my pup and [traveling to sometimes off the beaten path locations](https://puppiesarebarking.wordpress.com/). 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Research Impact Metrics
- Managing Scholarly Identities
- Reproducible Research 
- Digital Skills Development
