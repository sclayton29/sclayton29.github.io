## About Me
Hi! My name is Sarah Pugachev (formerly Sarah Clayton). I am a librarian interested in how technology can be used thoughtfully to benefit research and teaching. I am especially passionate about digital literacy and open access.

Currently, I am the Research Initiatives Librarian at the University of Rochester River Campus Libraries. I work on projects related to increasing the visiblity of scholarship. Before coming to UR, I was a digital scholarship specialist at the University of Oklahoma Libraries. 

[I was named a Library Journal Mover and Shaker in 2017](https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=sarah-clayton-movers-shakers-2017-digital-developers#_). I have been a certified [Carpentries' instructor](https://carpentries.org/) since 2016 and an instructor trainer since 2018. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Research Impact Metrics
- Managing Scholarly Identities
- Reproducible Research 
- Digital Skills Development
